# employee-tracker

## Description

The motivation for this project was to create a command line application that can store, access, and update employee information. I built this to practice using node and mysql to connect to a local database. It solves the problem of storing and accessing important information on employees and being able to see the information in a structured table on the command line. I learned a lot about how to add and view data using only node and mysql.

If you select to add or update a department, role, or employee, you need to input the text and press enter and a prompt will appear to let you know you were successful.
